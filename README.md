This are Hannah's Solutions to some USACO Problems. Most of them are on my computer and not shared online. Once and a while I will get through a hard question so i think 
it would be a good idea to write up an explanatoin as if i'm trying to explain it to somebody else. I also want to review my code once in a while. Therefore, I decided to create
this space so that I can easily access my code and explanation while im out of my house.
